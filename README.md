#Bad-UI
The Bad UI was done entirely in Vanilla JS in my 4th Week of Coding training. To incorporate my love for Physics and Games I wanted to make a small game with a rudimentary physics engine that has gravity. Works best in chrome since I hadn't learned of workers at that point.

#Webshop
Small websop front and backend I did in the 3rd Month of my coding training using Spring, Spring Security, SQL and Vue, the frontend was developed with a Swagger API already in place the backend is modeled after said Backend
