# DemoProject
Small websop front and backend I did in the 3rd Month of my coding training, the frontend was developed with a swagger API already in place the backend is modeled after said Backend minus the authentication layer

There is identical Backend Folder in which I started building a Spring Security authentication implementation that I overhauled later in the registration folder

The alternate Backend contains a more solid security for which the postman collection is designed
